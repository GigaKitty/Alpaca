# Alpaca

Portable collection of microservices for Alpaca trading that can be deployed to AWS ECS using Copilot. Services are split into different tools and strategies for trading. Some services talk to other services, while others are standalone. The project currently uses copilot to deploy microservices so they are easy to manage and scale. This also runs locally using docker-compose for development and testing.

## purpose

To create microservices that can used off the shelf with minimal effort that can be deployed via docker anywhere with minimal setup.

## Architecture
As mentioned it's microservices architecture has a lot of moving parts and each of them are designed to be flexible using a 12factor app methodology. Aside from the core services each service is designed to be a single use service that can be deployed and scaled independently of the other services. The services are designed to be stateless and can be scaled horizontally to handle more load. 

Redis is used for pub/sub and some storage of information that can be destroyed.
Marketstore is for storing historical data and is used for backtesting and other data analysis.
InfluxDB is used for storing time series data that can be used for analysis and other purposes.
Loki is used for logging and is used to store logs for analysis and debugging.


## Contributing

You can easily contribute or request your own bots to this project or other projects on GigaKitty for other trading platforms by creating a new service. There is a step-by-step guide in the example service or you can contact us for more info just open an issue to open a comms link.

## COPILOT AWS
  ### Application
  The project consists of a single application "Alpaca" that make up the project.

  ### Services

  AWS copilot services are broken down into microservice architecture having each it's own responsibility. The services are as follows:

  #### svc guidelines

  - Instantly deployable and usable all three envs
    - local using `docker-compose.yml`
    - GitHub codespaces
    - AWS copilot (ECS)
  - Run without intervention from trader once it's going it doesn't stop or need kicked
  - Have clear documentation or at least clean code to understand implementation
  - Simple micro service single use
  - Minimal dependencies

  游릮 Idea
  游리 WIP
  游릭 Production

### 游릭 beancleaner

A cleanup service that will periodically clean up trades based on a pre-determined price and time criteria.
For instance:

- Every Weekday at 12:59EST close all trades that aren't excluded like long term holds

### 游릭 earnyearn
A service

### 游릭 slanger

TradingView webhook processing service. This service listens for webhooks from TradingView and executes orders based on the payload. Different strategies and order types can be used to execute orders on different endpoints.

## Deploying

Local:
```docker-compose up -d```

AWS:
```copilot jkqsvc```

Codespaces:

### Prerequisites

- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
- [AWS Copilot](https://aws.github.io/copilot-cli/docs/getting-started/install/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### TradingView WebHook Alerts

These are the alerts that are configured in TradingView to send webhooks to the API. The alerts are configured to send a POST request to the API with the following JSON payload.

```{
    "action": "{{strategy.order.action}}",
    "alert_message": "{{strategy.order.alert_message}}",
    "close": "{{close}}",
    "comment": "{{strategy.order.comment}}",
    "contracts": "{{strategy.order.contracts}}",
    "exchange": "{{exchange}}",
    "high": "{{high}}",
    "id": "{{strategy.order.id}}",
    "interval": "{{interval}}",
    "low": "{{low}}",
    "open": "{{open}}",
    "position_size": "{{strategy.position_size}}",
    "prev_market_position": "{{strategy.prev_market_position}}",
    "prev_market_position_size": "{{strategy.prev_market_position_size}}",
    "price": "{{strategy.order.price}}",
    "ticker": "{{ticker}}",
    "time": "{{time}}",
    "signature": "REPLACE_ME"
}
```

the `signature` field is a HMAC signature of the payload using the secret key. The secret key is stored in AWS Secrets Manager and is used to verify the payload is coming from TradingView.

You paste this JSON into the alert settings "Message" field in TradingView. You will also need to directly edit the "Webhook URL" field in TradingView to include the name of the endpoint you want to trigger. If anyone has an automated solution to creating alerts that doesn't have an ultra high overhead or violate TradingView T&C please let know.
