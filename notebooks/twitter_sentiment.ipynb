Cryptocurrencies are already known to move heavily based on perception, so it could be that there is an edge to monitoring the sentiment on platforms like Twitter. Today, we’ll be building a bot that fetches the most recent tweets regarding ETHUSD, performs sentiment analysis on those tweets, and places trades based on the polarity scores.\n",

We’ll be using the python package NLTK to score each tweet based on whether it seems positive, negative, or neutral. If the average polarity score for all the tweets is positive, we’ll initiate a long trade on ethereum. Likewise, if the average polarity score for all the tweets is negative, we’ll sell any current position in ethereum."
